It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a cognitive map. Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term and long-term memory.

It appears to be very important in converting things that are â€œon one's mindâ€ at the moment (in short-term memory) into things that one will remember for the long run (long-term memory). If the hippocampus is damaged, a person cannot build new memories and lives instead in a strange world where everything he or she experiences just fades away, even while older memories from the time before the damage are untouched (a condition depicted in the films Memento and 50 First Dates).\n\n -  Amygdala: Involved in signaling the cortex of motivationally significant stimuli such as those related to reward and fear in addition to social functions such as mating. Furthermore, the anatomy of amygdalae are two almond-shaped masses of neurons on either side of the thalamus at the lower end of the hippocampus. The amygdalae stimulate the hippocampus to remember many details surrounding the situation, as well.[1]\n\n -  Fornix: is a C-shape bundle of axon that carries signals from the hippocampus to the mammillary bodies and septal nuclei.\n\n -  Mammillary body: locates at the ends of the anterior arches of the fornix. It is involved with the process of recognition memory.\n\n - Septal nuclei: Located anterior to the interventricular septum, the septal nuclei provide critical interconnections. The septal area isn't related to the sense of smell, but is the pleasure zone in animals.\n\n-  Limbic lobe\n\n -  Parahippocampal gyrus: Plays a role in the formation of spatial memory.\n\n -  Cingulate gyrus: Autonomic functions regulating heart rate, blood pressure and cognitive and attentional processing.\n\n -  Dentate gyrus: thought to contribute to new memories."
